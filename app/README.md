- Added functionality to scroll through tasks
- User can click on a task and the app will take them to the TaskDetailActivity page with the updated title
- APK updated
- Added enum class for the Task Model with new, assigned, in progress, and complete taskState (located under models)
- See main update to homepage with Recycler. I kept the original buttons in case I wanted to do something with them later.
- To do later: make margin between recycler buttons smaller and add more css.
